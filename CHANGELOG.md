# Changelog

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/celemas/container/compare/0.4.0...HEAD)

No notable changes since the last release.

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/celemas/container/releases/tag/0.4.0) (2026-05-12)

### Breaking Changes

- Rename package metadata, root namespace, repository URLs, homepage, and author info.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/celemas/container/releases/tag/0.3.0) (2026-04-26)

### Breaking

- `Entry::asIs()` was renamed to `Entry::value()`.
- `Entry::reify()` was removed.
- The root container now seals internal structural mutation after the first `scope()` call.
- Shared entries now resolve in definition-owner context, while scoped and transient entries resolve in requester context.
- Wrapped PSR container fallback now routes through the root container during scoped resolution.

### Added

- Explicit `Entry` lifetimes with `shared()`, `scoped()`, `transient()`, and `lifetime(...)`.
- `Container::scope()` for isolated per-unit-of-work containers.
- `Resettable` and scope-local `Container::reset()` cleanup support.

### Changed

- `Container` now keeps runtime instances in container-local caches instead of on `Entry` objects.
- `Container::definition()` now resolves definitions through parent containers (for example from tags).
- Scope tags now layer over matching root tags and keep scope-local caches.
- Scope reset now clears local entries/caches and resets used resettable services (including scope tags).
